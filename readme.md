# Dashboard Project

This is a Django-based dashboard project designed to provide insights and visualizations for energy data. The project includes a RESTful API built with Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL for data storage, and CORS support for cross-origin requests.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Exposes energy insights data via a REST API.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores energy-related data efficiently.
- **CORS Support**: Allows cross-origin requests for frontend integration.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides powerful tools for building APIs.
- **Django Filters**: Enables filtering of API data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dashboard-project.git
   cd dashboard-project
2.**Set up a virtual environment**:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3.**Install dependencies**:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  Set up the PostgreSQL database:

4.**Create a database named dashboard_db in PostgreSQL**.
Update the DATABASES configuration in settings.py with your PostgreSQL credentials:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'dashboard_db',
        'USER': 'your-username',

  python manage.py createsuperuser

6.**Run the development server**:
  python manage.py runserver

7.**Access the API**:

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/energy-insights/.
Access the Django admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
